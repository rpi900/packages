.SH NAME
rpi900\-pacman - pacman with configuration for remote RPi900
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rpi900\-pacman
\fIoperation\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [\fItargets\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rpi900\-pacman
is a wrapper for the
.B pacman
package manager, configured specifically for RPi900 remote stations connected via PPP to an RPi900 base station.
.PP
The slow connection on a remote RPi900 can cause pacman to give 404 errors when connecting to the standard Arch Linux repositories.
To overcome this problem,
.B rpi900\-pacman
uses the package cache on the RPi900 base station as a repository.
Connection to the repository is made via SSH and SSHFS.
No setup is required on the base RPi900.
.PP
To make a package available for a remote RPi900 using
.BR rpi900\-pacman ,
first install or download the package on the base RPi900 using pacman.
On the remote RPi900, use
.B rpi900\-pacman
with the same options as you would normally use for pacman.
You will be prompted for the root password for the base RPi900 as part of the connection process.
.PP
If your command includes a database refresh (e.g. the
.I \-Sy
option), the repository database on the base RPi900 will be automatically updated with any new packages which are found on the base.
(This may take some time, depending on the number of additions.)
.SH OPTIONS
As per
.BR pacman (8).
.SH FILES
.I /etc/pacman.d/rpi900.conf
.RS

including the custom repository.
Add any pacman options you need to this file, just as you would normally with
.IR /etc/pacman.conf .
